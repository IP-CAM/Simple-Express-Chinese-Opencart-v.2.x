# Simple and fast configuration 

For OpenCart, you can enter the courier number for your order, you do not need to specify the courier company, and the customer can view logistics information at the front desk order.

The express query interface is [快递 100] (http://www.kuaidi100.com), refer to [here] (https://github.com/jiayouzl/express), thanks [Author] (https: // github. COM / JIAYOUZL).

Make sure OpenCART has already installed VAMOD.

Install the XML file, then refresh and add permissions to the administrator group. Can be found under Sales / Orders.

Download [VQMOD for OpenCart] (http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&ofo ts ion_id=19501), [VQMOD] (https://github.com/vqmod/vqmod)

Put the VQMOD file in the SYSTEM in the same directory, execute the example.com/vqmod/install, pay attention to permissions;
